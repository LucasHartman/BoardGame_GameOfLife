ABOUT THE GAME
The Checkered Game of Life, a morality game of virtue vs. vice similar to Ivesâ€™ 1843 The Mansion of Happiness. The object is to be the first player to reach Happy Old Age.

ABOUT ME
At the start of 2020 when the Coraona crises hit the globe, I lost my job. Sitting home I had sometime to explore different skills.
Programming seemed always as a inposible job to do as an designer, but I was curcious and wanted to try and understand what it means to code.
I the next 3 months I learned the logic behind coding, did a bunch of exercises, done some math along the side and read number of books on the subject.
Learning coding made so much sense and it gave me great intellectual satisfaction. But putting this knowlegde into practise, always and up in failer.
Later on I understood this problem as the 'Feynman effect'. The only way to overcome this is to do it yourself, by playing and reavanting what I learned. 
So I started out with a three goals in mind:
1. Make a project which is possible at my skill level and learn a much a possible along the way
2. Do it in a timeline which is realstic like 2 months.
3. Finish what you have started.
I did reached two of the 3 goals, I took me much more time than I thought it would be, but I came to a finised project and learned more that I could imagine.
Along the way I learned how to; Java, JavaFX, CSS, XML, working on a Linux system,  Eclipse, build layout in SceneBuilder, Github, and much more.

ABOUT APP
This game application is my first coding project I made, since I learned Java.
The GUI is build in JavaFX 14.0.1, using Eclipse and SceneBuilder.
The visuals were made in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
